# Change Data Capture -> Kafka scrub code

Ok straight up - I haven't done all the whatnot you need on here to deploy, or added deploy steps. But you can look at the app.js file and get a feel for what this does.

Big ups to https://github.com/heroku/no-kafka for how I'm hitting kafka and used my old PlatformEventsNodeDemo repo as a baseline for pulling in CDC.
